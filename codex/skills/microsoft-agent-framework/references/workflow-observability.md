# Workflow Observability

Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/observability

Key points:
- Workflows emit additional spans, logs, and metrics beyond standard GenAI telemetry.
- Observability helps track executor performance, message flow, and errors.
- Use the general Agent Framework observability setup (see `references/observability.md`).
